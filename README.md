Created for a class project by Simon Diaz-Ordaz and Cole Coffey. 
Using a set of menus and shape creation functions, the user decides what shape to print, then inputs a series of parameters to customize the look of the shape. 
The program then outputs the shape and asks the user if they want to repeat the process until the user decides to stop.
